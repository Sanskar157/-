        Dependent Origination (Paticca Samuppada) â€“ The 12 Links
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Buddhism teaches that all things arise due to causes and conditions. The 12 links of dependent origination explain how suffering (dukkha) continues in an endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara).
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Each link conditions the next, meaning if one exists, the next follows. Understanding these links helps to break free from suffering and attain Nirvana.

            description: "Ignorance is the root of all suffering. It is the lack of understanding of impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anatta). Due to ignorance, people believe in a permanent self and chase worldly desires. This creates karma, binding them to samsara.",
            example: "A person believes that wealth or relationships will bring permanent happiness, unaware of their impermanent nature."

            description: "Consciousness arises from past karma and determines where a being is reborn. It carries forward previous mental formations into a new existence. Consciousness is not a soul, but rather a stream of momentary experiences.",
            example: "After death, a personâ€™s karma leads to rebirth in a new body, continuing the cycle of suffering."

            title: "4. Nama-Rupa (Mind & Body)",

            description: "When the senses come in contact with an object, experience arises. Contact conditions feeling, leading to craving.",

            title: "8. Tanha (Craving/Desire)",
            description: "Craving is the fuel that keeps samsara turning. Desires arise for sense pleasures, existence, or even non-existence. Craving leads to clinging, which strengthens suffering.",
            example: "A person desires fame, wealth, or relationships, believing they will bring lasting happiness."

        <li><strong>Wisdom (Panna)</strong> â€“ Seeing things as they truly are.</li>

        When ignorance is removed, the entire chain collapses, leading to Nirvana (liberation from suffering).
